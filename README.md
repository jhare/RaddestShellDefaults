RadddestShellDefaults
=====================

My shell profiles and scripts that are default to a new environment I come by. What I have
here is vestigial compared to what used to be, but was lost from several changes of
organziations. This won't happen again.

**To-do:**
* Need to split regular functions between bashrc and bash_profile. The bashrc is too heavy.
