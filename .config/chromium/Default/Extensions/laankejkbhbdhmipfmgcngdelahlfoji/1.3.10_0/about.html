	    Does this sound familiar?

You sit down at the computer, and you swear you'll be productive. Next thing you know, it's twelve hours later. You've checked your email, updated your Facebook status, browsed the trending topics on Twitter, read your RSS feeds, looked up your favorite band on Wikipedia, vanity googled yourself, cyber-stalked your ex, looked at all your high-school crushes' Facebook photos, and lost a week's pay playing online poker. What you haven't done is WORK.

The fact is, it's very hard to stay focused on work or school when you have all the world's information, news, music, and *cough*porn*cough* at your fingertips. Sometimes self-control is in short supply, and you need a little help keeping on track.

StayFocusd is a productivity extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on work by restricting the amount of time you can spend browsing time-wasting websites. Once your alloted time for the day has been used up, the sites you have blocked will be inaccessible for the rest of the day.

It is highly configurable, allowing you to block or allow entire sites, specific subdomains, specific paths, or even specific pages. 

That means you can block delicious.com, while still allowing access to delicious.com/save so you can add new bookmarks. Or you can block google.com/reader while still having access to the rest of Google's sites.

StayFocusd was developed by Warren Benedetto at Transfusion Media (http://www.transfusionmedia.com), a Los Angeles based creative studio specializing in graphic design, PHP/MySQL programming and Flash development for Facebook apps, Flash widgets, websites, and Rich Internet Applications.
